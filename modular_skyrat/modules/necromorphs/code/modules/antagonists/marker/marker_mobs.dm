	## TEMPORARY FILE FOR FUNCTION ONLY ##
	## MOBS SHOULD NOT BE STORED IN THE MARKER CODE##
	## ALL MOBS EITHER NEED TO BE SEPERATE SIMPLE MOBS OR CARBONS##


	This is only temporary, as the marker should spawn carbons that are player controlled, not
	simple mobs. All mobs are spawned based on a currency system known as BIOMASS which will need
	to be implemented and a value applied to all /datum/species/necromorph/(variants)

	Currently the species are not loading properly, they are missing their head and torsos and appear
	to be still wearing underwear even with the "NO_UNDERWEAR" trait applied at the parent and individual
	level.
