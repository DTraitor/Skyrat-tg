## About The Pull Request

	Initial PR put up for others to help support this project that are interested. Those interested in seeing a design doc for development purposes please reach out to me. This is not ready for merge. There are alot of updates that need to be made for this to be fully functional. 
	 
	modular_skyrat\modules\necromorphs\__TEMP__
	- Contains all basic files (Not Including Sound and Icons) to use as reference for what needs to be done to make everything function.
	
	modular_skyrat\modules\necromorphs\code\modules\antagonists\ai_marker 
	- Contains a very simple variation of the marker (Small) as a test of utilizing Mold Code as a potential AI Variation

	modular_skyrat\modules\necromorphs\lib
	- Contains the core code for utilizing the Vector2 function.
	- modular_skyrat\modules\necromorphs\code\_helpers Contains the helpers that are utilized in many of the original scripts.
	
	modular_skyrat\modules\necromorphs\code\modules\antagonists\marker
	- A patchwork piece of blobcode to use as a test of utilizing blob code over Baycode Vines for the spread of the Marker. 
	
	modular_skyrat\modules\necromorphs\code\modules\clothing\spacesuits\rig\modules\kinesis
	- Considered to be one of the largest challenges in porting features from DS13 to TG. Ensuring the kinesis system can still function. With the introduction of MODSuits, it will have a perfect home once functionality is finished.

	modular_skyrat\modules\necromorphs\code\modules\mob\living\carbon\human\species\necromorph
	- The location of all necromorph's (You will need to check the _TEMP_ folder to find all variables that are used in necromorphs as these have been stripped down during initial creation)
	
	modular_skyrat\modules\necromorphs\code\modules\mob\living\simple_animal
	- Unfinished Simple_Animal versions of Necromorphs. They have not been finished as they would need a system similar to carbon bodyparts for the components to be properly pulled together.
	
<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from merging your PR! -->

## How This Contributes To The Skyrat Roleplay Experience

	It doesnt yet :)

<!-- Please add a short description of why you think these changes would benefit the game and the roleplay atmosphere of the server. If you can't justify it in words, it might not be worth adding. -->

## Changelog

<!-- If your PR modifies aspects of the game that can be concretely observed by players or admins you should add a changelog. If your change does NOT meet this description, remove this section. Be sure to properly mark your PRs to prevent unnecessary GBP loss. You can read up on GBP and it's effects on PRs in the tgstation guides for contributors. Please note that maintainers freely reserve the right to remove and add tags should they deem it appropriate. You can attempt to finagle the system all you want, but it's best to shoot for clear communication right off the bat. -->
