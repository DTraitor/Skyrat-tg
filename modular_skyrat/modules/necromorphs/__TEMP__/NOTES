This folder contains most of the files that made the necromorphs function. I am constantly finding new ones
so this is not a complete collection as many of the functions are spread out across the original
codebase. This folder is not going to stay, do not utilize it for any code work beyond reference
and understanding. I tried to keep the file structure the same to what is in DS13
I will add anymore files i find that help create the necromorphs beyond the normal.
